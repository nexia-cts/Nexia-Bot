## Vanilla Combat Test 8a and 8c Installation guide

### First a few important notes

- The Combat Tests are forks of various versions made by jeb\_, this means that you will be playing with some bugs from back then.
- Although since it's a fork, it's not on the Vanilla Launcher, so the installation is a bit different and slighly more complicated.
- **CTS** means Combat Test Snapshots
- There is an specific fabric version for CTS: **<https://github.com/rizecookey/fabric-installer/releases/tag/0.11.1>** for the installation of fabric head to <#1132688511305273416>, here you will also find a **Mod List** which we recommend.

## Windows/MacOS/Linux Installation (automatic)
A new tool released called the **Combat Test Installer**, using this you can install any combat test snapshot you want using a GUI.

Download the tool from: **https://github.com/nexia-cts/combat-test-installer/releases**
Requirement: **[Java 8](<https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp>) or later**

## Windows Installation (manual)

### Step 1

Installing the latest version, 8c: **[Recommended]**

Download the version from: **<https://www.rizecookey.net/dl/file/combat-test-patched/1_16_combat-6.zip>**

That version **fixes** the **Log4J vulnerability**, although if you want the version made by **jeb_**, here is the original link:
||<https://launcher.mojang.com/experiments/combat/ea08f7eb1f96cdc82464e27c0f95d23965083cfb/1_16_combat-6.zip>||

### 8a: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oRmYoklkSu9QArdgnlMKy6MPMj0awk6G/view?usp=share_link>

### Step 2

Putting the version in your `.minecraft` folder.

Press the open button after clicking on the link shown above, this should open the zip file directly.
!!!!!!!!! END OF TEXT 2 !!!!!!!!! step2_download.png !!!!!! END OF TEXT 2 !!!!!!!!!
After clicking on the open button you will be in the zip file, left click once on the folder named: `1_16_combat-6` **(8c)** or `1_16_combat-4` **(8a)**

And copy it, by pressing `CTRL + C` at the same time.

### Note: You don't copy the **.zip** file only the folder within it

Now click the same bar as shown in the following screenshot:
!!!!!!!!! END OF TEXT 3 !!!!!!!!! step2_folder.png !!!!!! END OF TEXT 3 !!!!!!!!!
In that bar type `%appdata%`, this will direct you to the `Roaming` folder, and there navigate to `.minecraft` and then towards `versions`.

```
C:\Users\[YOUR_NAME]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\versions
```

now when you are in the versions folder paste the folder you copied earlier into the folder if done correctly your versions folder should now contain the `1_16_combat-6/4` version(s)

### Step 3

Launching the game.

Open the Minecraft launcher, go to installations and check the following boxes:
!!!!!!!!! END OF TEXT 4 !!!!!!!!! step3_mc_installations.png !!!!!! END OF TEXT 4 !!!!!!!!!
Create a new installation with "pending 1.16_combat-6" as version.
!!!!!!!!! END OF TEXT 5 !!!!!!!!! step3_mc_new-installation.png !!!!!! END OF TEXT 5 !!!!!!!!!
In order to find the correct version type in "pending" as shown below:
!!!!!!!!! END OF TEXT 6 !!!!!!!!! step3_mc_find-version.png !!!!!! END OF TEXT 6 !!!!!!!!!
Click on the version you downloaded.

```
pending 1.16_combat-6 = 8c
pending 1.16_combat-4 = 8a
```

Now press the **green** create button.

Navigate towards the **Play** Tab and make sure the **correct version** is selected.

## Common Issues

### 1: The version folder has 2 folders within each other in it
!!!!!!!!! END OF TEXT 8 !!!!!!!!! common_issues1-2folders.png !!!!!! END OF TEXT 8 !!!!!!!!!
In order to fix this, copy `(CTRL + C)` the **.json** file and **navigate towards** the folder before where the **.json** file is.

After navigating there and having copied the .json folder make sure it looks like this:
!!!!!!!!! END OF TEXT 9 !!!!!!!!! common_issues1-2folders_fix1.png !!!!!! END OF TEXT 9 !!!!!!!!!
Paste the **.json** in this folder and delete the folder where you just came from, visible here so that it looks like this:

**Note: ** ***First*** copy the file then delete the folder!

### 2: "Sorry, unable to start minecraft"

As of now, it's unknown what exactly causes this issue however there is an fix for it.

Our suspicions are that it's an issue that Mojang has on their side within the launcher.
!!!!!!!!! END OF TEXT 11 !!!!!!!!! common_issues2-unable_to_start.png !!!!!! END OF TEXT 11 !!!!!!!!!
To fix this issue you will need to install either **MultiMC** or **Prism Launcher**.

**Prism Launcher: <https://prismlauncher.org/download/>**

If you want to use **MultiMC**, but don't have it installed, you can download it by following this YouTube tutorial:
**<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrkpb0n4CRo>**

**If you have already played Minecraft 1.16+ you won't need to follow the Java Installation part.**

Now after having setup **MultiMC** or **PrismLauncher**, press add instance and make sure the following is selected:
!!!!!!!!! END OF TEXT 12 !!!!!!!!! common_issues2-unable_to_start_fix.png !!!!!! END OF TEXT 12 !!!!!!!!!
Then press **"OK"** and **double click** the instance to launch it.
